Introduction

Churn prediction is a critical task in the telecom industry, where retaining customers is essential for business success. This project focuses on using logistic regression to predict customer churn based on various features and historical data.

Project Overview

The project is divided into several key steps:

Importing Libraries: In this step, we import the necessary Python libraries required for data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning.

Importing Dataset: We load the dataset containing telecom customer information and historical churn data.

Cleaning Data: Data preprocessing is a crucial step in any machine learning project. Here, we clean the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and performing any necessary data transformations.

Variable Imbalancing: Imbalanced datasets can lead to biased models. In this step, we address class imbalance issues using techniques such as oversampling or undersampling.

Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Python (3.x) installed on your system.

Jupyter Notebook for running the project code (optional but recommended).

Required Python libraries listed in the project's environment or requirements file.

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute to this project.
